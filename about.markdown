## About blogs
At the end of 2020 I decided to migrate some of my old posts to the beautiful Jekyll theme called [Chirpy][]. I started to slowly transform my pen-and-paper notes as well into blog posts.

This place is a sort of  digital notebook where I jot things down. Even though I primarily intend it for my own use, I also strive to explain things clearly in the hope that other people might find value in these posts.
